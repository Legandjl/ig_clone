# Photo Sharing app modelled after Instagram

# Features

Users use Google to authenticate, and a user profile is generated from their Google account. If the users Google profile picture is changed, the user profile on the app should update to reflect that change upon login.

Users can upload, like other user uploads, comment on uploads and follow other users.

Users will receive notifications when followed, and if their upload is liked.

Notifications are removed if a user likes then unlikes a post, or follows then unfollows. Notifications can also be deleted by the receiver.

Users can choose to display either all uploads, or only uploads from users they are following, both sorted by timestamp.

Users can delete any comments or uploads that they have made.

# Notes

This was quite a complicated project and my biggest one in React so far, and there are definitely things I would change within the code if I were to start over. However I am happy overall with how it turned out, and feel I learnt a lot by taking my time.

I decided against implementing any further features (ie search or message functionality) as I have already spent more time than anticipated with this project, and I'm eager to move onto the next challenge.
